This repository contains Python codes developed by me, along with small fragments of code copied from tutorials, forums, or other learning resources compiled by me. The goal is to learn and experiment with concepts and techniques. Some of these codes were used in my projects.

If any fragment infringes copyright, please let me know so I can take corrective action.
